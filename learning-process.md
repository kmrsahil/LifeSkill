3. Remove barriers to practice.
4. Practice at least 20 hours.

### Question 5: What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- **Implement the Feynman Technique:** Teach concepts to others to solidify understanding.
- **Utilize Active and Diffused Thinking:** Alternate between focused and relaxed states for better comprehension.
- **Deconstruct Learning Goals:** Break down topics into manageable parts for effective learning.
- **Practice Regularly:** Dedicate consistent time to practice and reinforce learning.
- **Seek Feedback:** Actively seek feedback to identify areas for improvement.
- **Stay Organized:** Use tools like deadlines and tracking apps to stay on track with learning goals.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Reflect on learning methods and adapt strategies based on what works best.
